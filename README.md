# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam – IT & DevOps Engineer | Automation Enthusiast | Cloud-Native Builder

🚀 I help teams move faster, safer, and smarter by automating infrastructure, scaling systems, and building resilient CI/CD pipelines.

🔧 **What I Do:**
- Automate everything with Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Ansible
- Build secure, scalable platforms on AWS, GCP & Kubernetes
- Monitor, alert, and visualize using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki
- Ship faster with ArgoCD, Helm, and GitOps best practices

📌 This GitHub is where I build in public — from real-world projects to open-source tools that solve everyday DevOps problems.
